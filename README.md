# 440-cisplatin: Cisplatin Resistance in Ovarian Cancer

This repo contains the code to reproduce all of the analyses in "Identifying novel pathways involved in resistance to cisplatin" by Divya Ravinder and Susana Hawken.

The raw RNA-seq data is available on [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM2589608). 

# Reproducing Analysis

## Installing
To reproduce the analyses performed in this project, you'll need to install the required tools. 

Download STAR: Genetics at [http://star.mit.edu/genetics/download/index.html](http://star.mit.edu/genetics/download/index.html). You will use this to process the raw RNA-seq data and obtain transcript counts for each condition.

You should also download R for reproducing the analyses.
Download R version 3.4.1 (or latest version) at [https://www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org).
